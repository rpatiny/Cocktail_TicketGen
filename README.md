# Cocktail_TicketGen
A Cocktail Bar ticket machine(for training recipes)


So, I'm studying JS and have the idea to use this project as a way for me to study for a bartender 
position in a hotel close to my home. It's a little hard to find job but working with this is very 
fun and make me feel better.

If one day You're passing thought the same situation, please, use my code to study, hahaha.


Thanks for reading me.
